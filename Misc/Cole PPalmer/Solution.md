This program, hinted at by the name "Cole PPalmer" (C++), involves C++ binary data manipulation. It presents two challenges requiring bitwise operations and binary conversions, where the <bitset> library becomes essential.

Why <bitset>?

Allows easy binary representation of numbers (e.g., std::bitset<8>(42) converts 42 to 00101010).

Supports bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, shifts) in a readable way.

Helps in debugging by displaying binary values cleanly.

Here is some functions :
